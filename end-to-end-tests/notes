start the servers:
  elasticsearch
  the app (cd ../rest-server && ./run.sh)
  webdriver-manager start # start selenium server in separate terminal

protractor conf.js # runs the tests

I followed instructions from protractor project web site. It did not mention
chrome anywhere, but this is what gets used for running tests on my machine.
Not sure if that is because chrome is my default browser or this is the
default for protractor/selenim/webdriver or whatnot.
