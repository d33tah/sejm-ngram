install dependencies
    brew install nodejs # will install npm too
    npm install -g protractor # installs under /usr/local/lib/node_modules
    webdriver-manager update # this downloads Selenium to aforementioned dir

This is not truly end to end yet. It does not use the backend. For now
only start a server that serves the static files with mock data.

./start-server.sh # in a separete terminal
webdriver-manager start # start selenium server in separate terminal
protractor conf.js # runs the tests

I followed instructions from protractor project web site. Did not mention
chrome anywhere, but this is what gets used for running tests on my machine.
Not sure if that is because chrome is my default browser or this is the
default for protractor/selenim/webdriver or whatnot.
